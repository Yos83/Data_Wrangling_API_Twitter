The purpose of this project is to use Twitter data on dog ratings to create a comprehensive analysis of user preferences and to classify the most popular dog breeds. This will be achieved by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize images from Twitter's database.

### Purpose
Udacity Data Wrangling Project of WeRateDogs Tweets. A project requirement for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The objective is to go through the process of Data Wrangling (gathering data from different sources and formats, assessing and cleaning the data) extensively for Data Analysis and Visualization.

For more details on the steps taken, check the Data Wrangling Report. Findings about the data can be found on the Data Analysis Report.

## Requirements
The following python libraries are needed:

pandas
matplotlib
